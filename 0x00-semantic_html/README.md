# 0x00. Semantic HTML

## Description
This project focuses on building a solid foundation in Semantic HTML while emphasizing accessibility, SEO optimization, and the implementation of ARIA roles for enhanced usability. Through incremental tasks, we structure and enhance a web page to make it not only visually structured but also optimized for screen readers and search engines.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Optimize web pages for SEO using meta tags and proper document structure
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA roles and attributes
